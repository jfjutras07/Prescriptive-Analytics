# Prescriptive Analytics

This repository contains prescriptive analytics projects across multiple domains, including municipal governance, healthcare, and international development. Projects explore a variety of prescriptive techniques, including optimization, simulation, decision-support models, and resource allocation.

## Organization
Each project is contained in its own folder at the root of this repository.

## Technical Stack
Python | R | SQL | OR-Tools | Pyomo | pandas | numpy | matplotlib | seaborn | plotly

## Notes on Project Maturity
This repository serves both as a portfolio and as a continuous development environment. Some projects are intentionally scoped to explore specific optimization methods, decision frameworks, or scenario analysis techniques. Insights and improvements from these projects are progressively consolidated into a shared prescriptive framework used across more comprehensive end-to-end decision-making projects.
