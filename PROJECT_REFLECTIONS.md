## This document is part of a continuous improvement approach in my Prescriptive Analytics projects.

For each project in this repository, I include:
  
  - The project name and its completion date
  - A link to the corresponding notebook or repository
  - One key weakness identified in the project that will be addressed in the next one to improve overall quality and analytical rigor.

The purpose is to document my learning progression transparently and ensure that every project directly contributes to developing stronger, more efficient, and more reliable analytical practices.
