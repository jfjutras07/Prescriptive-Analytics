## This document is part of a continuous improvement approach in my Prescriptive Analytics projects.

For each project in this repository, I include:
  
  - The project name and its completion date
  - A link to the corresponding notebook or repository
  - One key weakness identified in the project that will be addressed in the next one to improve overall quality and analytical rigor.

The purpose is to document my learning progression transparently and ensure that every project directly contributes to developing stronger, more efficient, and more reliable analytical practices.

### Project 1

**Project Name**: Integrated Decision Support System

**Month**: January 2026

**Link**: [Integrated Decision Support System](https://github.com/jfjutras07/Prescriptive-Analytics/tree/main/Integrated_Decision_Support_System_(IDSS))

**Weakness identified**:

For this prescriptive analytics project, I realized I need to better justify the use of mathematical tools to ensure robust results. Prescriptive modeling is demanding because it directly drives decision-making, so every choice of method and parameter should be clearly explained and defensible.
