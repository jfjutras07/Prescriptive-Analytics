    "In modern complex environments, organizational success isn't just about making \"good\" decisions; it's about the integration of decisions across different temporal and functional scales. Isolated financial metrics or static rankings are no longer sufficient to navigate uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces PARO (Projects, Assets, Risks, and Operations), a multi-layered Decision Support System (DSS) designed to bridge the gap between long-term strategy and daily execution. By simulating a cohesive corporate ecosystem, this series of notebooks demonstrates how Prescriptive Analytics can transform raw data into optimal action plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this series, we will develop interconnected prescriptive modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Project Portfolios and Projects**: Strategic Portfolio Optimization under resource constraints and prescriptive project management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assets**: Life-cycle management and optimal replacement scheduling.\n",

    "- **Risks**: Modeling for organizational resilience and mitigation investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operations**: Logistical and tactical flow optimization.\n",
