    "# Integrated Decision Support System: The PARO Framework\n",
    "### Part 1: Strategic Foundations & Organizational Digital Twin\n",
    "\n",
    "In complex organizations, performance does not stem from isolated “good decisions,” but from the coherence of decisions made across strategic, tactical, and operational horizons. Portfolio choices, asset policies, risk exposure, and day-to-day operations are deeply interdependent, yet they are often designed and optimized in isolation. The result is not local inefficiency, but systemic fragility: plans that appear optimal on paper but break down in execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project introduces PARO (Projects, Assets, Risks, and Operations), an integrated Prescriptive Decision Support System designed to structure, prioritize, and operationalize a portfolio of initiatives within a unified organizational model. Rather than treating projects as independent investments, PARO models the organization as a living system in which strategic intent, resource constraints, uncertainty, and execution dynamics continuously interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is not to produce a static ranking or a single “optimal” answer, but to design a decision architecture that enables leaders to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select and prioritize projects under constrained and uncertain resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make trade-offs across competing objectives explicit and interpretable\n",
    "\n",
    "- Translate strategic choices into executable and operationally feasible plans\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adapt decisions as conditions evolve over time\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this architecture, the organization is represented as a digital twin, integrating financial, operational, and human constraints into a coherent prescriptive framework. Each analytical module addresses a specific decision layer, while remaining explicitly connected to the others, ensuring that strategic choices remain feasible, robust, and actionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first installment establishes the Strategic Foundations of the PARO framework: the overall decision logic, the risk-aware modeling philosophy, and the synthetic data architecture that powers the organizational Digital Twin.\n",
