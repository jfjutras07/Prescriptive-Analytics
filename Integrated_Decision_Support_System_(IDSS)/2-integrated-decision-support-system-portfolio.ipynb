    "In this notebook, we transition from foundational modeling to prescriptive decision-making. The goal is to evaluate the full set of proposed projects for the 2026-2028 cycle and determine which initiatives should be prioritized to maximize strategic value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on three core steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Presenting Proposed Projects**: Review all initiatives identified for the 2026-2028 portfolio.  \n",
    "- **Minimum Project & Asset Data**: Explain some of the essential fields collected for some projects and associated assets, providing the baseline for informed evaluation.  \n",
    "- **Project Prioritization Exercise**: Apply linear programming to optimize the portfolio under the $1,000,000 budget and finite operational capacities, ensuring that selected projects effectively mitigate strategic risk and generate tangible organizational impact.\n",

Each department must make clear trade-offs and limit initiatives in flight, otherwise the portfolio will exceed real absorption capacity and create delivery risk rather than value."

Against this backdrop, the portfolio generates a total demand of **14,918** hours, but its distribution reveals a significant structural challenge: while 2026 (**3,989** hours) and 2028 (**2,240** hours) appear manageable, the year 2027 faces a massive surge with **8,689** hours demanded.\n",

    "This distribution is fully aligned with the company’s mission, which is primarily project-driven rather than asset-centric. When integrating the granular costs from the consolidated master files, the Total Material Budget is established at **528,500** dollars and the Total Human Budget reaches **2,697,509** $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the Total Required Budget for the portfolio reaches **3,226,009** $. Given the current **1,000,000** dollars threshold, the financial exposure is more than triple the available funding. This significant gap confirms that the organization cannot absorb all proposed initiatives simultaneously. It reinforces the necessity of a disciplined, data-driven prioritization exercise to identify which projects offer the highest strategic return on investment while remaining within the strict 1M financial boundary."

These effects are explicitly captured and assessed at the initial evaluation stage, as they directly influence future capacity, cost structure, and execution risk. \n",

    "The baseline portfolio shows a relatively high financial exposure, with an Average Budgetary Risk Index of 8.01 / 10, indicating that certain initiatives involve significant budgets and execution risk. The projects flagged as High-Risk Budget ([26, 28]) therefore represent critical points for financial planning and monitoring.\n",

Results should therefore be interpreted as structural insights rather than exact forecasts. |\n",

    "| **Human Behavior** | No behavioral or political dynamics | The model assumes rational execution and compliance. Informal power dynamics, resistance to change, learning curves, and morale effects are not explicitly modeled. |\n",
    "| **Strategic Bucketing** | Structural rigidity of allocation constraints | Strategic budget buckets (even with ±5% tolerance) impose artificial ceilings and floors that may restrict emergent or opportunistic strategies in extreme conditions. |\n",
    "| **ROI Measurement** | Narrow financial ROI definition | ROI focuses on quantifiable financial returns and costs, potentially undervaluing intangible benefits such as reputation, knowledge accumulation, cultural change, or strategic option value. |\n",
    "| **Temporal Resolution** | Discrete yearly phasing | Project phasing is modeled at an annual level, which may obscure intra-year peaks, short-term bottlenecks, or sequencing effects that occur at finer time scales. |\n",
    "| **Interdependencies** | Limited cross-project synergies | While prerequisites are modeled, positive synergies and negative interference effects between concurrent projects are only partially captured. |\n",
    "| **Scalability** | Computational and data complexity | As the number of projects, roles, and time periods increases, model complexity and solve time may grow non-linearly, limiting real-time or enterprise-wide deployment without simplification. |\n",
    "| **Decision Ownership** | Model does not replace governance | The framework supports decision-making but does not arbitrate strategic intent. Executive judgment is still required to validate trade-offs, override constraints, and accept non-financial outcomes. |\n"
